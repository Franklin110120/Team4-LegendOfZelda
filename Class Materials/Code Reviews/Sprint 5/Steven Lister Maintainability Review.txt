Comments:				The code is incredibly simple and easy to understand, making its maintainability great. It would be easy for anyone with a basic understanding of the project to go in and
						perform any necessary updates or implement changes. The moveability of the block item is also elegantly implemented. The code can be reused for any block, making it a central
						point of control.
