Sprint number:			Sprint 5

Name of .cs file:		UtilityClass.cs

Author of .cs file:		Neil Dey

Number of minutes:		5 minutes

Comments:				This class looks much better than before. The maintainability 
						of this is slightly low though, because you have to search 
						through the entire file to find something. Maybe it could 
						be ordered in some way?
