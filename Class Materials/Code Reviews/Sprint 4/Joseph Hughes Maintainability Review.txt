Comments:				This class looks great. I do believe that you need to make a method for each sound, 
							because the only one I can hear in game is the link damaged one when he's facing 
							to the east. Other than that, this class seems like it is easy to maintain and use. 
							The fact that it is a singleton keeps it secure and makes it able to be used throughout 
							the game, which is very useful.
