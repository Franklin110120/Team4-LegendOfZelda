Comments:				The maintainability of this code is good. Though the update and draw method inside 
						the class has many different foreach loop, overall the class is clear and neat. 
						Generally, the class is for room initialization so it would be many different cases
						for special event, enemy or item. But it is also a point to improve the 
						initialization to have the method that dealing with the special case.
