Comments:         There are quite a few inconsistencies in spacing within 
                    this file. I know this came from people going through 
                    adding and remove parts of the class, but we should 
                    always try to leave the class readable after every edit. 
                    All of the variable names are descriptive, which helps 
                    me know what is going on without any need for comments. 
                    There are some inconsistencies with naming, however, 
                    since some public fields aren't in Pascal case and the 
                    constants are not all caps. Further, a couple of the 
                    variables use underscores, which is inconsistent with 
                    our naming conventions throughout the rest of the project. 
                    Overall, this class needs to just fix several inconsistencies 
                    in both spacing and naming.
