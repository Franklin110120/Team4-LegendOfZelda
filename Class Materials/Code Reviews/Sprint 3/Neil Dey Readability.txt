Sprint number:			Sprint 3

Name of .cs file:		Level1.xml

Author of .cs file:		Peter Su / Neil Dey

Number of minutes:		7 minutes

Comments:				Overall, this xml file is highly readable. All the elements' names and attributes are descriptive. That being said, I think the numbering of the
						rooms could be formatted in a way that's more intuitive to make reformatting the room numbers simpler. I don't think that someone outside the team
						would understand our numbering system well enough to update the numbering if additional rooms were added. A simpler format would be left to right	
						and top to bottom.
