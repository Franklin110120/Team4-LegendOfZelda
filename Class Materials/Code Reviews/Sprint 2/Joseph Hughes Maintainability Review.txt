Sprint number:			Sprint 2

Name of .cs file:		Bomb.cs

Author of .cs file:		Steven Lister

Number of minutes:		5 minutes

Comments:				This code does not have much cohesion, since it keeps track of the
						sprite that will be printed, the location of the sprite, and the state
						of the player. This could lead to some possible maintainability issues,
						since this class would have to be altered if any one of its fields is
						changed. Further, this class does not actually do that much, since it
						just tells state to do something and the sprite to do something. This
						functionality of the class could also be more complete by adding in more
						fields for Link's health and list of items in his inventory.
