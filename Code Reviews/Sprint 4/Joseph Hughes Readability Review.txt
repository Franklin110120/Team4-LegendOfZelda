Comments:         Overall, this class is easy to read an comprehend. I do believe 
					you should make the timer in all caps as well as of type const 
					int, since it is a constant. Further, I think there should be 
					a new line between each method, because right now it is a little 
					hard to follow with no spaces at all. Lastly, there are a bunch 
					of unnecessary use statements at the top.
