Comments:		The maintainability of this code is good. Though this class is in slightly low 
 			cohesion, it is a fundamental class that required to has many parameters set up inside. The 
			largest improvement of this class might be trying to decouple the set angle process into a 
			new class, which can be used by the rest of projectile classes for initialization.
