Comments:				This class is pretty easy to understand as the variable names are descriptive and it has but a few methods. The biggest threat to its readability is the lack of comments.
						For example, the "count" and "maxcount" variables do not indicate their purpose even though their name is descriptive. Aside from this, the logic is easily understandable and
						nothing within the class is overcomplicated due to the encapsulation of many actions within other classes. Since the method names from those external classes are clear, so are
						the lines where they're used within this class.
