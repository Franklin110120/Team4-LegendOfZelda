Comments:				This class should be easy to maintain in future visits as it has pretty high cohesion. All methods in this class are directly related to the function
						of the class with a constructor and an execution function the only two methoods contained in it. These two methods are used to one create an instance
						of the class and the other is instructions for the class on what to do when called. While this class has relatively low coupling, it uses it when 
						necessarry in order for the code to be more readable.
