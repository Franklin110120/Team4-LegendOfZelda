Comments:				To keep this class from having too many dependencies, you should 
                  remove the fields for player and room and replace them with a 
                  single field for level. Level contains both of those, so you can 
                  just access them through the level. Further, you should then no 
                  longer pass level into update but instead pass it into the constructor 
                  and reference it with a level field.
