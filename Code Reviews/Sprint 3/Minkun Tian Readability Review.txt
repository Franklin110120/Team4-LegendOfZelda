Comments:				Overall, the readablity for this class is good. It has methods for different nodes in the XML 
						file, which is used for generating the game objects such like dungeon Enemies, dungeon items, 
						and NPCs. around and being damaged. In each method, the loader indentifies the attribute of 
						each node and generate the object that has the same name in the attribute. Then, it returns
						the specific room with the game object set in.
