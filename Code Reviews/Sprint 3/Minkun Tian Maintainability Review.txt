Comments:				The maintainability of this code is good. Though this class in very high cohesion, It keeps
						track the transition of each room. It is a fundamental class that has parameters set up 
						inside. The largest improvement of this class might be trying to decouple the transition
						into different classes, which can be used for transition with different Directon.
