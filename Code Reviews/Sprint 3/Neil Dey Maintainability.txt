Comments:				The maintainability of this code is good since its pretty simple. The function of the class is apparent but the one drawback
I'd mention is that there aren't comments indicating what parts of the code are doing. For example, it took me a little bit to figure out exactly why the for each loop was necessary.
Also, there are occasional spelling errors like the name of one of the methods, "detact" (should be detect)
