Comments:				This code has good maintainability. The main drawback of this class is that the initialization of the keyboard controller, command list, as well as some other	
                        member variables could be moved to a separate class so that the beginning of this one isn't so long. Most of the initialization code isn't relevant to the main purpose of this class
						so it's not necessary to have here. That being said, it's organized in a way that is clearly understandable.
