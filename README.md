# Team4-LegendOfZelda
CSE 3902 Project

Known Bugs: Currently our command classes are not working so we were unable to test the functionality of many things. 
Also our some of our sprites are too large and others are so small we dont even know if they are there.

Sprint reflection:	We as a team might have overloaded a couple members more than others thereby causeing our team to suffer as a result. 
					We had a couple members working on many things that backed up eachother. We plan to fix this for the next sprint by planning the 
					sprint out better with the use of more concrete plans and maybe some diagrams to better improve work flow as we left the command class 
					off to the end too much to test the rest of our project.
