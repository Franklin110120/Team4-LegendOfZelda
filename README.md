CSE 3902 Project

Known Bugs: Currently, we have some issue with Link's movement that needs to be fixed soon. Further, the enemy logic is still not as it should be and the level loading is currently lacking a good way to determine the locations of enemies and items. We also need to add the ability for Link's and an enemy's health to change. Lastly, we are missing the Old Man and the flames in the dark room, since our rooms do not have a way to store NPCs currently.
